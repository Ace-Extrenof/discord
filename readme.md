# Rosé Pine for BetterDiscord

> Maintained by our lovely community ☺️

All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.

Based on Spectra's Nocturnal theme

Tested on Discord + BetterDiscord, Discord Beta + BetterDiscord, Discord Canary + BetterDiscord, and my personal favorite, [Lightcord](https://lightcord.github.io/). 

## Usage

1. Place `Rose-Pine.theme.css` in your BetterDiscord themes folder. This can be found by going to User Settings --> Themes (Under Bandaged BD) --> Open Theme Folder
2. Go back to the themes settings (User Settings --> Themes (Under Bandaged BD)) and check the Rosé Pine theme
